        <h1>About Mac'Lurkin</h1>

        <p><strong>Mac'Lurkin</strong> is an esports team forged from grit, instinct, and a shared love for competition. Founded by <strong>Renokas1</strong> and <strong>TechnoGustav</strong>, we began as a small group of friends grinding late-night Valorant lobbies — and grew into a focused, ever-evolving team aiming for the top tiers of the competitive scene.</p>

        <p>Our primary battleground is <strong>Valorant</strong>, where every round is a test of reflexes, communication, and trust. We don’t just play to win — we play to outsmart, outmaneuver, and outlast. Each of us brings a unique playstyle, but together, we form a cohesive unit that thrives under pressure and adapts in real time.</p>

        <p>The name "Mac'Lurkin" represents more than a tag — it’s our mindset. It’s the quiet confidence before a clutch. The lurking flank that flips a round. The calm before the chaos. We believe in playing smart, striking fast, and always backing each other up — no matter the odds.</p>

        <p>Beyond the game, Mac'Lurkin is a creative force. We produce content, support new talent, and build a growing community of players and fans who share our passion. Whether it’s tournaments, scrims, or late-night streams, we bring energy, personality, and a relentless drive to improve.</p>

        <p>We’re not here to follow trends — we’re here to set them. And this is only the beginning.</p>
